## Summary
By gathering temperature at the half way points of the year, a broad picture of the overall temperature trends of Oahu, Hawaii become known. While a low of 56 isn't the most ideal time to surf and eat ice cream, December still has some warmer days with 50% of the data tracking at 71 degrees. I recommend doing additional queries for precipitation and most active stations. These queries will give a more complete understand of all temperature trends and if a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu is sustainable year-round.
